            Cricket: A Gentleman’s Game
        </h3>

        <hr>

        <p class="ms-4" style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
            Cricket, often regarded as a gentleman’s game, has its roots in 16th-century England. Today, it is a beloved sport in countries like India, Australia, England, and Pakistan. Cricket is played in various formats, including Test matches, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and the fast-paced T20s, each offering a unique flavor of the game. <br><br>

            The essence of cricket lies in its blend of strategy, skill, and patience. The game is played between two teams of eleven players, with the objective of scoring more runs than the opposition. Iconic tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup and the Indian Premier League (IPL) have elevated the sport to new heights, drawing massive audiences and fostering fierce rivalries. <br><br>

            Cricket’s influence extends beyond the boundaries of the field. It has united nations, provided a platform for diplomacy, and inspired countless individuals. Legendary players like Sir Donald Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, and Virat Kohli have etched their names in the annals of cricketing history, inspiring generations of players and fans.
